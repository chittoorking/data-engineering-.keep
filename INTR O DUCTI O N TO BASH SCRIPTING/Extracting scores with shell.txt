There is a file in either the start_dir/first_dir, start_dir/second_dir or start_dir/third_dir directory called soccer_scores.csv.
It has columns Year,Winner,Winner Goals for outcomes of a soccer league.

cd into the correct directory and use cat and grep to find who was the winner in 1959. You could also just ls from the top directory if you like!


repl:~/start_dir$ ls -R
.:
first_dir  second_dir  third_dir

./first_dir:

./second_dir:
soccer_scores.csv

./third_dir:
repl:~/start_dir$ cd second_dir/ && cat soccer_scores.csv | grep "1959"
1959,Dunav,2
