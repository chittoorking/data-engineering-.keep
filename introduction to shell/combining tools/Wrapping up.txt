Use wc with appropriate parameters to list the number of lines in all of the seasonal data files. 
(Use a wildcard for the filenames instead of typing them all in by hand.)

Add another command to the previous one using a pipe to remove the line containing the word "total".

Add two more stages to the pipeline that use sort -n and head -n 1 to find the file containing the fewest lines.


$ wc -l seasonal/*.csv 
  21 seasonal/autumn.csv
  24 seasonal/spring.csv
  25 seasonal/summer.csv
  26 seasonal/winter.csv
  96 total
$ wc -l seasonal/*.csv | grep -v total
  21 seasonal/autumn.csv
  24 seasonal/spring.csv
  25 seasonal/summer.csv
  26 seasonal/winter.csv
$ wc -l seasonal/*.csv | grep -v total | sort -n | head -n 1
  21 seasonal/autumn.csv
