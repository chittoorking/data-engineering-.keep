mv can also be used to rename files. If you run:

mv course.txt old-course.txt
then the file course.txt in the current working directory is "moved" to the file old-course.txt. This is different from the way file browsers work, but is often handy.

One warning: just like cp, mv will overwrite existing files.
If, for example, you already have a file called old-course.txt, then the command shown above will replace it with whatever is in course.txt.

Instructions
Go into the seasonal directory.

Rename the file winter.csv to be winter.csv.bck.

Run ls to check that everything has worked.

$ cd seasonal/$ mv winter.csv winter.csv.bck
$ lsautumn.csv  spring.csv  summer.csv  winter.csv.bck
