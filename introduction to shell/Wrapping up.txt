You will often create intermediate files when analyzing data. Rather than storing them in your home directory,
you can put them in /tmp, which is where people and programs often keep files they only need briefly.
(Note that /tmp is immediately below the root directory /, not below your home directory.) This wrap-up exercise will show you how to do that.

Use cd to go into /tmp.

List the contents of /tmp without typing a directory name.

Make a new directory inside /tmp called scratch.

Move /home/repl/people/agarwal.txt into /tmp/scratch. 
We suggest you use the ~ shortcut for your home directory and a relative path for the second rather than the absolute path.

$ cd /tmp/$ ls
tmpgdu6coxc$ mkdir scratch
$ mv /home/repl/people/agarwal.txt scratch/
