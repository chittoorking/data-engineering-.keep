The other kind of variable is called a shell variable, which is like a local variable in a programming language.

To create a shell variable, you simply assign a value to a name:

training=seasonal/summer.csv
without any spaces before or after the = sign. Once you have done this, you can check the variable's value with:

echo $training
seasonal/summer.csv
Instructions 

Define a variable called testing with the value seasonal/winter.csv.

Use head -n 1 SOMETHING to get the first line from seasonal/winter.csv using the value of the variable testing instead of the name of the file.


$ testing=seasonal/winter.csv

$ head -n 1 $testing
Date,Tooth
