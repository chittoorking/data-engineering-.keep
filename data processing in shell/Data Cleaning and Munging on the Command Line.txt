First step in learning about any libraries, tools, or suite of tools is to make sure we are using the latest and most stable version.

Second step is to make sure we know how to access the documentation so we know where to go when we get stuck.

Let's do both in this exercise for csvkit and the various commands in this suite of data processing command-line tools.

Upgrade csvkit to the latest version using Python package manager pip.

# Upgrade csvkit using pip  
pip install --upgrade csvkit 

Print the manual for in2csv on the command line.

# Print manual for in2csv
in2csv --help

Print the manual for csvlook on the command line.

# Print manual for csvlook
