csvsql can be used to join CSV files together even when neither of them are in a database.
Here, we have two CSV files Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv and Spotify_Popularity.csv that are both on song level but contain different attributes for each song.
We can combine the two files together using a SQL-like JOIN, and we can do so, through the power of csvsql.


Explore the data with the commands we have learned so far (e.g. csvstat, csvlook, etc). 
What is the column that Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv and Spotify_Popularity.csv have in common that can be used as the JOIN key?


$ csvcut -n "Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv"

  2: danceability
  3: duration_ms
  4: instrumentalness
  5: loudness
  6: tempo
  7: time_signature
$ csvcut -n "Spotify_Popularity.csv"

  Ans : 
  track id


Join Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv and Spotify_Popularity.csv together to form a new file Spotify_FullData.csv.

# Store SQL query as shell variable
sql_query="SELECT ma.*, p.popularity FROM Spotify_MusicAttributes ma INNER JOIN Spotify_Popularity p ON ma.track_id = p.track_id"

# Join 2 local csvs into a new csv using the saved SQL
csvsql --query "$sql_query" Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv Spotify_Popularity.csv > Spotify_FullData.csv

# Preview newly created file
csvstat Spotify_FullData.csv
