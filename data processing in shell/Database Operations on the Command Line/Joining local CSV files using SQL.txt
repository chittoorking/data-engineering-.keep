csvsql can be used to join CSV files together even when neither of them are in a database.
Here, we have two CSV files Spotify_MusicAttributes.csv and Spotify_Popularity.csv that are both on song level but contain different attributes for each song.
We can combine the two files together using a SQL-like JOIN, and we can do so, through the power of csvsql.


Explore the data with the commands we have learned so far (e.g. csvstat, csvlook, etc).
