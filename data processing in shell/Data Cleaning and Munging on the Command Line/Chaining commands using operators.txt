The more we use command-line tools, the more we start stringing complex commands together. Sometimes it's for convenience, but other times, the output of one command can be used as input to another. Let's get some hands on practice with this by filling in the correct chain operators for the circumstances described in the instructions below.

Instructions 
Use the chain operator that allows csvlook to run first, and if it succeeds, then run csvstat.

Use the chain operator that to pass the output of csvsort as input to csvlook.

Use the 2 chain operators that takes the top 15 results from the sorted output and saves it to a new file.

# If csvlook succeeds, then run csvstat 
csvlook Spotify_Popularity.csv && csvstat Spotify_Popularity.csv

# Use the output of csvsort as input to csvlook
csvsort -c 2 Spotify_Popularity.csv | csvlook

# Take top 15 rows from sorted output and save to new file
csvsort -c 2 Spotify_Popularity.csv | head -n 15 > Spotify_Popularity_Top15.csv

# Preview the new file 
csvlook Spotify_Popularity_Top15.csv
