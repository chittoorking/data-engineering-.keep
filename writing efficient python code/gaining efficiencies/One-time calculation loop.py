# A list of integers that represents each Pok√©mon's generation has been loaded into your session called generations.
# You'd like to gather the counts of each generation and determine what percentage each generation accounts for out of the total count of integers.

# The below loop was written to accomplish this task:

# for gen,count in gen_counts.items():
#     total_count = len(generations)
#     gen_percent = round(count / total_count * 100, 2)
#     print(
#       'generation {}: count = {:3} percentage = {}'
#       .format(gen, count, gen_percent)
#     )
# Let's make this loop more efficient by moving a one-time calculation outside the loop.

# Instructions
# Import Counter from the collections module.
# Use Counter() to collect the count of each generation from the generations list. Save this as gen_counts.
# Write a better for loop that places a one-time calculation outside (above) the loop. 
# Use the exact same syntax as the original for loop (simply copy and paste the one-time calculation above the loop).

# Import Counter
from collections import Counter

# Collect the count of each generation
gen_counts = Counter(generations)

# Improve for loop by moving one calculation above the loop
total_count = len(generations)

for gen,count in gen_counts.items():
    gen_percent = round(count / total_count * 100, 2)
    print('generation {}: count = {:3} percentage = {}'
          .format(gen, count, gen_percent))
# output:
#   generation 4: count = 112 percentage = 15.56
# generation 1: count = 151 percentage = 20.97
# generation 3: count = 136 percentage = 18.89
# generation 5: count = 154 percentage = 21.39
# generation 2: count =  99 percentage = 13.75
# generation 6: count =  68 percentage = 9.44
